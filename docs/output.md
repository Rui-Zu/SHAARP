# Output Results
The content in the Output Panel depends on which mode is chosen in the Functionalities of the [Input Panels](input). 
## Numerical Simulation 
>![[img/Pasted image 20220529115720.png]]
>**Output panel for Numerical Simulation**

This panel contains:
- the 2D/3D schematics of the setup (upper two figures)
- polarplot of the reflective SHG wavs (middle two figures) 
- the refractive indices as a function of the incident angle (Snell's law) for the fundamental $\omega$ wave (lower left figure)
- the ellipticity figure (lower right figure)

==Rui, can you swap the positions of 2D/3D schematics and the two polar plots? It makes more sense to have schematics at the beginning ==
==Also, can you make Snell's law figure to be square? Put AspectRatio ->1==


## Partially Analytical Expression

>**Output panel for Full Analytical Expression** 

This panel contains partially analytical expression of output variables assuming symbolic SHG tensor and polarization angle $\varphi$.  
- The meaning of all the symbols are given in the [Table](table of symbols.md). 
- One can copy the analytical expression by click the Copy button on the left. 

## Fully Analytical Expression

>**Output panel for Fully Analytical Expression**

This panel contains fully analytical expression of output variables assuming known reflective and refractive angles.  
- The meaning of all the symbols are given in the [Table](table of symbols.md). 
- One can copy the analytical expression by click the Copy button on the left.
