# Numerical Simulation
## Anisotropic Second Harmonic Polarimetry
### Configuration of Polarizer(E^ω)/Analyzer(E^2ω)
- Various Experimental Geometries, e.g., SHG vs. crystal in-plane rotation
### Complex ε ̃^ω and ε ̃^2ω
- Materials with absorption at either ω or 2ω
- Resonance enhanced SHG
### Accurate ε ̃^ω and ε ̃^2ω (measured by tools, such as ellipsometry or reflectivity)
- Absolute SHG response with input SHG coefficients
### Complex SHG coefficients, d
- Precise SHG response with complex d
### Ellipticity, (phase shift ∆δ) for incident wave (E^ω)
- Polarized SHG response under circular or elliptical polarized light
