## GaAs(111) at 800 nm
### SHG Simulation
GaAs crystallizes in a cubic structure with the point group $\overline{4}3m$ and its linear and nonlinear optical properties have been extensively studied. In this example, the polarized nonlinear optical response will be simulated and derived both numerically and analytically.

Here, in the **geometry plot**, $(L_1,L_2,L_3)$ depicts the lab coordinate system forming a right-handed coordinate, and the normal of surface (111) plane is parallel to the $L_3$ direction. The $L_1-L_3$ forms the plane of incidence (PoI) as colored in blue. The input <span style="background-color: #D3D3D3">[hkl]->Direction Perpendicular to Plane of Incidence</span> is set parallel to the $L_2$ direction. In the **polarization plot**, the both incident polarization at $\omega$ frequency and output SHG polarization at $2\omega$ frequency are rotated simultaneously with a same azimuthal angle $\varphi$. Two output SHG electric fields (colored in blue and red) with orthogonal polarization are collected.

- The intensity of the selected electric fields are plotted as a function of $(\varphi,\Psi)$ and plotted with the same color code as presented in **Polarization Relations**.

>SHG polar plots as a function of $(\varphi,\Psi)$. The directions of output polarization share the same set of color codes as presented in **the Polarization Relations** plot.


- The **Effective refractive index** and **Ellipticity** of incident light at $\omega$ are shown in the third row. In the **Effective refractive index** plot, the real parts of effective refractive indices are shown as a function of incident angle. Superscript 1 and 2 refer to ordinary and extraordinary waves. In cubic GaAs case, refractive indices are the same regardless of the directions of electric fields. In the **Ellipticity** plot, the phase relation of $E_p$ and $E_s$ is shown. If linear polarization is rotated, the ellipticity of light will be shown with $\varphi=45^o$, otherwise the explicit direction of $E^{\omega}$ will be shown.
