# Welcome to #SHAARP 
!!! note
	This project is under active development.

**SHAARP**_ _si_ is an open-source package for deriving and simulating reflected optical second harmonic generation (SHG) from a single interface (_si_), typically the surface of a single crystal. Optical SHG describes the process where two photons of frequency interact with a nonlinear medium (a crystal) to create a photon at 2$\omega$, so called the SHG process.  (A followup package for multiple interfaces is currently being developed).

This package builds in the most general approach to both analytically and numerically solving the surface SHG response of a single crystal surface with arbitrary crystal symmetry, arbitrary orientation and a complex dielectric function (complex refractive indices).

One important application of the code is to provide analytical expressions to fit experimentally measured polar plots for a nonlinear single crystal.  By such fitting, one can determine the point group symmetry, as well as determine the various nonlinear coefficients by comparing with a standard crystal whose nonlinear coefficients are known. A second application is to quickly generate the expected SHG polarimetry response from crystals whose linear and nonlinear properties are already known.

Follow the steps below to get started with the package. For more detailed information on **#SHAARP.****_si_**, please refer to the [manual](https://shaarp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
